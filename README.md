# BLASTn Variation for Probabilistic Genome Sequences
(Term Project for Computational Biology Methods and Research(COMP-561))

## Introduction
The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool(BLAST) has been widely used in searching and comparing newly discovered DNA and amino acid sequences within database that contain well-studied genome sequences. In this project, I defined a alignment scoring scheme and made adjustments to BLAST algorithm to work with probabilistic genome sequence query. A probabilistic genome sequence is a genome sequence such that the nucleotide at each position might not be certain, that is, another nucleotide could be placed there as well with a probability.
